HTTPS / SSL:

1. get / generate SSL certificate (*.key and *.crt files)
	1. NOTE: to get a "trusted" certificate (for production) that browsers won't issue a warning for, it will cost money (around $100 per year)
2. open port 443
3. configure (node) server to use certificates and HTTPS (instead of plain HTTP) and port 443

- startSSL for free (development) certificate

- generating self-signed certificate (using openSSL)

	- https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-endpoint#acquire-ssl-certificate
	- NOTE: can use 'localhost' for Common Name / domain
	
- using with node.js / express (already handled for you in MEAN-seed - just update `config.json` `ssl` field to point to your certs and be enabled)
